							<h1>Pooja Yadav</h1>
							<p style = "font-family:Times New Roman" align = "justify"> Watching Sundar Pichai talk about ‘Why Machine Learning is the future’ gave me a feeling of consciousness, back in 2017. 
								'Better computational power and access to a lot of relevant data are the two main causes of the progress in ML' he said.
								I've always felt this branch of computer science to be exciting, be it data analysis, or data visualization and emphasizing it with ML algorithms 
								or data storage. My immediate goal after masters is to become a Data Scientist. In the foreseable future, I see myself becoming a Data Scientist 
								as I am highly inspired by D J Patil, Former Chief Data Scientist at the White House, first ever chief data scientist appointed by US government. 
								His pointers about striving for curiosity, team building, social and local problem solving always inspire me to crave for becoming a CDS. 
								I am a motivated and a versatile engineer with demonstrated experience in Machine Learning and Data Analysis domain. 
								Experienced in data extraction, developing ML algorithms and developing final predictive model. 
								I am a strong problem solver, have excellent communication skills and dedicated to exceed goals and expectations.

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world.
								It is really important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around him or her.
								I have been coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my knowlegde, creativity, math and confidence.
