							<h1>Pooja Yadav</h1>
							<p> Watching a YouTube video titled ‘Why Machine Learning is the future’ by Sundar Pichai gave me a feeling of consciousness, back in February 2017. 
								He states that better computational power and access to a lot of relevant data are the two main causes of the progress in ML. Working with data - whether it is data analysis, 
								or data visualization and emphasizing it with ML algorithms or data storage has always made me feel exhilarating. 
								My immediate goal after masters is to become a Data Scientist. 
								In the long run I envision myself becoming a Data Scientist as I am hugely inspired by D J Patil, Former Chief Data Scientist at the White House, 
								first ever chief data scientist appointed by US government. His markers about striving for curiosity, team building, social and local problem solving always inspire me to crave for becoming a CDS.
								I am a motivated and a versatile engineer with demonstrated experience in Machine Learning and Data Analysis domain. Experienced in data extraction, developing ML algorithms and developing final predictive model. I believe that I am a strong problem solver, and have excellent communication skills. 
								I am dedicated to exceeding goals and expectations.

									<h2>Internships</h2>
									<p>Internships give the first hand exposure working in the real world. It allows us to implement skill, knowlegde and
										the theoretical practice learnt before. I beleive that it is a learning curve with little experience of the professional world.

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>I am of the opinion that hands on coding or projects are the basic literacy in the digital world.
								It is really important for a programmer to understand and be able to work with the technology around him or her.
								I have been coding since my engineering and below are a few examples to demonstrate my knowlegde, creativity, math and confidence.
